      Some of internally used C routines are now exported. This interface should be considered experimental. List of exported C routines and their signatures are provided below in the usage section.

      Details how to use those can be found in \emph{Writing R Extensions} manual \emph{Linking to native routines in other packages} section.
      An example use with \code{Rcpp}:
    \preformatted{
      dt = data.table::as.data.table(iris)
      Rcpp::cppFunction("SEXP mysub2(SEXP x, SEXP rows, SEXP cols) { return DT_subsetDT(x,rows,cols); }",
        include="#include <datatableAPI.h>",
        depends="data.table")
      mysub2(dt, 1:4, 1:4)
    }

      Be aware C routines are likely to have less input validation than their corresponding R interface. For example one should not expect \code{DT[-5L]} will be equal to \code{.Call(DT_subsetDT, DT, -5L, seq_along(DT))} because translation of \code{i=-5L} to \code{seq_len(nrow(DT))[-5L]} might be happening on R level. Moreover checks that \code{i} argument is in range of \code{1:nrow(DT)}, missingness, etc. might be happening on R level too.
