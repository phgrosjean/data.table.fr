  verbose:
    original: ' \code{TRUE} sets \code{options(datatable.verbose=TRUE)} for the duration
      of the tests. This tests there are no errors in the branches that produce the
      verbose output, and produces a lot of output. The output is normally used for
      tracing bugs or performance tuning. Tests which specifically test the verbose
      output is correct (typically looking for an expected substring) always run regardless
      of this option. '

  silent:
    original: ' Controls what happens if a test fails. Like \code{silent} in \code{\link{try}},
      \code{TRUE} causes the error message to be suppressed and \code{FALSE} to be
      returned, otherwise the error is returned. '

      Runs a series of tests. These can be used to see features and examples of usage, too. Running test.data.table will tell you the full location of the test file(s) to open.

      Setting \code{silent=TRUE} sets \code{showProgress=FALSE} too, via the default of \code{showProgress}.

      If all tests were successful, \code{TRUE} is returned. Otherwise, see the \code{silent} argument above. \code{silent=TRUE} is intended for use at the start of production scripts; e.g. \code{stopifnot(test.data.table(silent=TRUE))} to check \code{data.table} is passing its own tests before proceeding.
