      In case if a devel repository does not provide binaries user will need development tools installed for package compilation, like \emph{Rtools} on Windows, or alternatively eventually set \code{type="source"}.

      By default the function uses our GitLab-hosted R repository at \code{https://Rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table}. This repository is updated nightly. It runs multiple test jobs (on top of GitHub tests jobs run upstream) and publish the package (sources and binaries), even if GitLab test jobs are failing. Status of GitLab test jobs can be checked at \href{https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/web/checks/check_results_data.table.html}{Package Check Results}.\cr
      We also publish bleeding edge version of the package on GitHub-hosted R repository at \code{https://Rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table} (just minor change in url from \emph{lab} to \emph{hub}). GitHub version should be considered less stable than GitLab one. It publishes only package sources.\cr
      There are also other repositories maintained by R community, for example \code{https://rdatatable.r-universe.dev}. Those can be used as well, but as they are unlikely to provide git commit SHA, the function will install the package even if latest version is already installed.
